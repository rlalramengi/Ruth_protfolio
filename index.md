# Data Science Portfolio

Here are some of my best Data Science Projects. I have explored various machine-learning algorithms for different datasets. Feel free to contact me to learn more about my experience working with these projects.

[Rented Biak Count Prediction](https://github.com/rlalramengi/LinearRegressionProject1)

<img src="images/bikk.jpg?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib

**Project Objective:** Predicting Bike rental demand on basis of weather and seasonal factors in advance to take appropiate measures which finally will result in bike utilization.

**Quantifiable result:** We could predict the Bike rental demand resulting in [**56%** accuracy](https://github.com/rlalramengi/LinearRegressionProject1).

- Used linear regression to predict the number of bikes rented in the city of Seoul
- The data had quite a few categorical variables which were encoded for use in the model
- Encoded categorical variables to numeric using Sklearn due to the presence of many string columns
- Cross Validation for validating the training data and model fit.
- Fit a Random Forest Regressor with high prediction accuracy through iteration

[Talking Data Fraud Detection](https://github.com/rlalramengi/DT_And_Ensemble_Bagging_Boosting-Project)

<img src="images/CF.jpg?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib

**Project Objective:** In this problem, we will use the features associated with clicks, such as IP address, Operating system, device type ETC. To predict the probability of a click being fraud.

**Quantifiable result:** We could Classify whether a given click resulted in a download or not. The accuracy of XGBoostClassifier is [**99%**](https://github.com/rlalramengi/DT_And_Ensemble_Bagging_Boosting-Project). And the Bagging Classifier accuracy is [**99%**](https://github.com/rlalramengi/DT_And_Ensemble_Bagging_Boosting-Project).

- Used Ensemble technique to classify fraud clicks.
- Compared predictive performance by fitting a BaggingClassifier model to the data.
- Selected best model based on train and test performance.
- Explored Ensemble technique.

[Employee Compensation](https://github.com/rlalramengi/Employee_Compensation_K-means/blob/main/Kmeans_Clustering_Project.ipynb)

<img src="images/comp.jpg?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Cluster, Elbow

**Project Objective:** The San Francisco Controllerâ€™s Office maintains a database of the salary and benefits, paid to City employees since fiscal year 2013. This data is summarized and presented on the Employee Compensation.. 

**Quantifiable result:** We could Classify the type of tumor resulting in [**80%** accuracy using K-means algorithm](https://github.com/rlalramengi/Employee_Compensation_K-means/blob/main/Kmeans_Clustering_Project.ipynb).

- Used K-Means algorythm to create cluster depending on the Dataset.
- Used Elbow method to get the optimal number of cluster.
- Explored a Unsupervised learning approach to create data group.

[Identify Cat And Dog Image](https://github.com/rlalramengi/CNN_Image_classification)

<img src="images/dogorcat.jpg?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Keras, Tensorflow, Matplotlib, numpy

**Project Objective:** Prediction of whether a given image is a Cat or a Dog using Convolutional Neural Networks which may be further implemented as a feature in a bigger project.

**Quantifiable result:** We could train the Convolutional Neural Network to attain a accuracy of [**86%** using **25** epochs](https://github.com/rlalramengi/CNN_Image_classification).

- Added multiple convolution and pooling layers
- Training model on basis of given data
- Fitting the CNN to see if the provided image is dog or cat
