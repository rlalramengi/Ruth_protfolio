# Data Science Portfolio

Here are some of my best Data Science Projects. I have explored various machine-learning algorithms for different datasets. Feel free to contact me to learn more about my experience working with these projects.

[Examining the effect of environmental factors and weather on demand of Bike rentals](https://github.com/rlalramengi/LinearRegressionProject1)

<img src="bikk.jpg?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib

**Project Objective:** Predicting Bike rental demand on basis of weather and seasonal factors in advance to take appropiate measures which finally will result in bike utilization.

**Quantifiable result:** We could predict the Bike rental demand resulting in [**56%** accuracy](https://github.com/rlalramengi/LinearRegressionProject1).

- Used linear regression to predict the number of bikes rented in the city of Seoul
- The data had quite a few categorical variables which were encoded for use in the model
- Encoded categorical variables to numeric using Sklearn due to the presence of many string columns
- Cross Validation for validating the training data and model fit.
- Fit a Random Forest Regressor with high prediction accuracy through iteration

[Diagnosis of breast cancer using a logistic classifier](https://github.com/suvo-gh/Orthopedic-Patients-Classification)

<img src="images/breast-cancer.jpeg?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib

**Project Objective:** Identification of the type of Breast Cancer for quicker diagnosis. This assists professionals in the medical field to take appropiate measures to accurately diagnose, treat and save lives. 

**Quantifiable result:** We could Classify the type of tumor resulting in [**80%** accuracy using K-means algorithm](https://github.com/suvo-gh/Orthopedic-Patients-Classification).

- Used logistic regression to identify a tumour as malignant or benign based on various attributes
- Classified tumors as benign or malignant by studying patterns in measured attributes of those tumors
- Used Logistic regression classifier & optimized the accuracy by using the ROC curve
- Explored a machine learning approach to medical diagnosis

[Employee Compensation](https://github.com/rlalramengi/Employee_Compensation_K-means/blob/main/Kmeans_Clustering_Project.ipynb)

<img src="images/EC.webp?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Cluster, Elbow

**Project Objective:** The San Francisco Controllerâ€™s Office maintains a database of the salary and benefits, paid to City employees since fiscal year 2013. This data is summarized and presented on the Employee Compensation.. 

**Quantifiable result:** We could Classify the type of tumor resulting in [**80%** accuracy using K-means algorithm](https://github.com/rlalramengi/Employee_Compensation_K-means/blob/main/Kmeans_Clustering_Project.ipynb).

- Used K-Means algorythm to create cluster depending on the Dataset.
- Used Elbow method to get the optimal number of cluster.
- Explored a Unsupervised learning approach to create data group.

[Identifying given picture is a Cat or a Dog](https://github.com/rlalramengi/CNN_Image_classification)

<img src="images/Dog-and-Cat.jpeg?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Keras, Tensorflow

**Project Objective:** Prediction of whether a given image is a Cat or a Dog using Convolutional Neural Networks which may be further implemented as a feature in a bigger project.

**Quantifiable result:** We could train the Convolutional Neural Network to attain a accuracy of [**86%** using **25** epochs](https://github.com/rlalramengi/CNN_Image_classification).

- Added multiple convolution and pooling layers
- Training model on basis of given data
- Fitting the CNN to see if the provided image is dog or cat
